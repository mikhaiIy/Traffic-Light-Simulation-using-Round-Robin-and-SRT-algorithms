# ðŸš¦ Traffic Light Scheduling Simulation using Round Robin and SRT

This project simulates a traffic light control system using two scheduling algorithms: **Round Robin** and **Shortest Remaining Time (SRT)**. Inspired by CPU scheduling in operating systems, the simulation demonstrates how time-based and priority-based traffic control mechanisms can be used to manage a four-way intersection.

The program is written in **Python** and runs in the terminal with dynamic visual output. It allows users to choose between a balanced traffic scenario (Round Robin) or a dynamic emergency scenario (SRT with ambulance priority).

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… **Round Robin Scheduling** â€“ Each direction gets equal green light time in a cyclic order.
- ðŸš¨ **SRT with Ambulance Preemption** â€“ Traffic flow dynamically prioritizes the direction with an ambulance.
- ðŸ“Š **Real-Time Output** â€“ Terminal-based simulation shows green/red states per second.
- ðŸ“ˆ **Gantt Chart Ready** â€“ Timeline can be extended for plotting and analysis (using `matplotlib`).
- ðŸ§  **Educational Use** â€“ Great for learning scheduling logic and simulation development.
